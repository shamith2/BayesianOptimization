# BayesianOptimization

Researching into improving the performance of Bayesian Optimization in high-dimensional space. Resolved this issue by transforming the cube geometry of the search space into a cylindrical search space, thus, greatly reducing the time spent by Bayesian Optimization near the boundary of its search space for high dimensional inputs.
